Step 1:-
The Barabasiâ€“Albert model is one of several proposed models that generate scale-free networks.
BA model implements growth and preferential attachment which exist widely in real networks.

in the code for BA model networkx library used with 1009 random node.and 2 Number of edges to attach from a new node to existing nodes 
Step 2:-
plot the Degree distribution of BA Graph.
Step 3:-
Independent Cascade Model (ICM) is a stochastic information diffusion model where the information flows over the network through Cascade.
Nodes can have two states Active and Inactive.

1.implemented ICM(independent cascade model) passes paremeters as BA graph, random seed set of 15 node, probability(0.05 to 0.15) and simulation is 1000
2.Getting neighbour node of new node
3.Finding any node of neighbour can be activated then add them to new node 
4.checking Duplicate nodes and removing them
5.finally return the total active node after 1000 simulation in result.
Step 4:-
1.For Seed selection implemented Greedy on ICM, parameters as BA graph object and simulation.
2.Find nodes with largest marginal gain
3.Find nodes that are not yet in seed set to find biggest marginal gain
4.Get the spread by calling ICM 
4.Update the winning node and spread so far
5.Add the selected node to the seed set
6.finally Greedy on ICM output is total active node after 1000 simulation in result

Step 5:-
Linear threshold model used to find the behavior of influence propgation in social networks.
1.implemented LTM(linear thresold model)passes as BA graph object,random seed set of 15 node,and simulation is 1000
2.setting time limit 2
3.computed the thresold value
4.computed total weight
5.cheaching total weight is greater than thrshold or not
6.finally Greedy on ICM output is optimal seed set, estimated spread and elapes time in result

Step 6:-
1.For Seed selection implemented Greedy on LTM parameters as BA graph object and simulation.
2.Find nodes with largest marginal gain
3.Find nodes that are not yet in seed set to find biggest marginal gain
4.Get the spread by calling LTM 
4.Update the winning node and spread 
5.Add the selected node to the seed set
6.finally Greedy on LTM output is optimal seed set, estimated spread and elapes time in result
